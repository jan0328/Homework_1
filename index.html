                Cricket is played with a bat and ball and involves two competing sides (teams) of 11 players.
                The field is oval with a rectangular area in the middle, known as the pitch, that is 22 yards (20.12 metres)
                by 10 feet (3.04 metres) wide. Two sets of three sticks, called wickets, are set in the ground at each end of
                the pitch. Across the top of each wicket lie horizontal pieces called bails. The sides take turns at batting 
                and bowling (pitching); each turn is called an “innings” (always plural). Sides have one or two innings each, 
                depending on the prearranged duration of the match, the object being to score the most runs. The bowlers, delivering
                the ball with a straight arm, try to break (hit) the wicket with the ball so that the bails fall. This is one of several
                ways that the batsman is dismissed, or put out. A bowler delivers six balls at one wicket
                (thus completing an “over”), then a different player from his side bowls six

                    <li>Cricket is played between two teams each made up of eleven players. (Sometime in junior competitions you will find 8 player teams).</li>
                    <li>Games comprise of at least one innings where each team will take turns in batting and fielding/bowling.</li>
                    <li>The fielding team will have a bowler bowl the ball to the batsman who tries to hit the ball with their bat.</li>
                    <li>
                        The fielding team tries to get the batsmen out by…
                        <ul>
                            <li>Hitting the wickets with the ball when bowling</li>
                            <li>Catching a batsman’s shot on the full</li>
                            <li>Hitting the batsman’s leg in front of the wicket (LBW)</li>
                            <li>Or hitting the wickets before the batsmen can run to the other end of the pitch</li>

                        The batmen try to score as many runs as possible before getting out by…
                        <ul>
                            <li>Hitting the ball and running between the wickets and making it to the other end before the fielders can hit the wickets with the ball. Each time you run one full length of the pitch it equals 1 run.</li>
                            <li>Hitting the ball to the boundary along the ground is 4 runs.</li>
                            <li>Hitting the ball over the boundary on the full equals 6 runs.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>The fielding team must get 10 batsmen out before they can change over and start batting.</li>
                    <li>The aim of the game is to score as many runs as possible before the fielding team takes 10 wickets. The team with the most runs wins.</li>
